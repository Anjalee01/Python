# Assignment_03

# Question_01: Counting Down from a Given Number Using a While Loop 

# Description:

# 1. The program asks the user to input a starting number.


# 2. It uses a while loop to count down from the starting number to zero.
# 3. Inside the loop, it prints the current number and then decrements it by 1
#  (start_number -= 1).
# 4.  Once the number becomes less than zero, the loop stops, and it prints "Countdown finished!"

# starting_number = 5
# while starting_number>=0:
#     print(starting_number)
#     starting_number -=1 
# print("Countdown Finish!")


# Question_02: Number Guessing Game with a Constant Secret Number

# Description:

# 1. The program sets the secret_number to a constant value of 42.
# 2. It initializes the variable guess to None.
# 3. It prints an initial message explaining the game to the user.
# 4.The while loop continues to execute as long as the user's guess (guess) is not equal to the secret number (secret_number).

# Inside the loop, the program:
# 5. Prompts the user to enter a guess (guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))).
# 6. Check if the guess is less than the secret number. If so, it prints "Too low! Try again."
# 7. Check if the guess is greater than the secret number. If so, it prints "Too high! Try again."

# If the guess is correct, it prints "Congratulations! You guessed the secret number."
# Once the correct guess is made, the loop exits, and the program prints "Game over!".

# secrete_number = 42
# guess= None
# print("Hey")

# while guess != secrete_number:
#     guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
#     if guess < secrete_number:
#         print("Two low! Try again.")
#     elif guess > secrete_number:
#         print ("Too high! Try again.")
#     else: print("Congratulations! You guessed the secret number.")
# print("Game Over")
