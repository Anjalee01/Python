# Assignment_01

# 1.Write a Python program to print "Hello, World!".

print("Hello")
# 2.Declare a variable name and assign your name to it. Print the value of the variable.
# name =  "anjalee"
# print(name)
# 3.Declare variables using camelCase, snake_case, and PascalCase. Assign values to them and print each variable.
# firstName = "anjalee"
# Last_name= "ramwani"
# FatherName = "Moti Lal"
# print(firstName, Last_name, FatherName)
# 4.Write a Python program that declares a variable and prints its memory address using the id() function.

a = 3
print(id(a))


# 5.Write a Python program that takes user input and prints it.

# name = input("Enter your name")
# print(name)

# 6.Write a Python program to display the data types of different variables (e.g., integer, float, string).

a = 3
b = 3.5
name = "anjalee"
print(type(a), type(b), type(name))


# 7.Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and performs addition and subtraction. Display the results.

# a = 2
# b = 1
# print(a-b)
# print(a+b)

# 8.Write a Python program to demonstrate operator precedence. Use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in a single expression and show the result. (5 + 3 * 2 - 4 / 2)
 
# a = 5
# b = 4
# c = 3
# d = 2

# print (a + c * d - b  / d)


# 9.Write a  Python program to calculate the area of a rectangle based on user input for its length and width. 

# length= int(input("Enter length"))
# width = int(input("Enter width"))

# area = (length * width)
# print (area)


# Hint:  Take input from the user to enter the length of the rectangle.
# Take input from the user to enter the width of the rectangle.
# Area=length×width
# 10. Write a Python program that performs the following steps:
# ●Define a string vowels containing all lowercase vowels ('aeiou').

# ●Take input from the user to enter a letter (lowercase). Check if the entered letter is 'a' using membership operators (in or not in). Print True if the entered letter is 'a', otherwise, print False.
# vowels = 'aeiou'

# letter = input(" Enter letter ")

# print (letter in 'a')
